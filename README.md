[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue)](https://www.python.org/)


A Q-Learning implementation to solve OpenAI Gym's FrozenLake-v1 environment. The agent learns to navigate a slippery frozen grid to reach the goal while avoiding holes.


## Features
- Q-Learning algorithm implementation
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- Performance tracking with success rate metrics
- Visualization of training results

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
